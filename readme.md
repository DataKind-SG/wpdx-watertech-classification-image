## Welcome to the Water Tech Image Classification Project!

This project is a part of the collaboration between Water Point Data Exchange (wpdx) and DataKind Singapore.

WPDX aims to automate the water pump labeling when volunteers upload water point data to their website.
In line with this, we'll be helping them create models which classify the water pump images and the water tech descriptions accordingly.

The following are the associated tasks:
1. From the WPDX dataset, extract relevant water pump images (photo_lnk) to a file
2. Associate the images (photo_lnk) with their labels (water_tech)
3. Use the extracted data to create a model
4. Create a sample app to demo the model to WPDX team.

Sample Label: PHE 6 Hand pump
